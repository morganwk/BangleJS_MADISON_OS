0.01: New App!
0.02: Apparently this freaking thing checks the changelog. Bull. One more thing to keep track of. I might just not increment the number until after major updates.
0.03: Actually decided to call the function this time. Hope that does it. Also added a vibration to test feedback. No functionality yet.
